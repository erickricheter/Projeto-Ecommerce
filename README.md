# Pet house E-commerce Project.

Developed an ecommerce project using React.js and styled components, for the college. 
Although it was my first project in React, I am proud of the outcome achieved. The application was designed in a simple and objective way, with the intention of exercising the skills acquired in the language and development tool.

## Technologies used:
JavaScript: Programming language used in the project.
HTML: Markup language used in building the website.
CSS: Styling language used in styling the website.

## How it works

Pet House is an e-commerce platform dedicated to pet lovers where they can buy pet food, toys, and equipment. As it is a basic front-end project, it only has the basic functionality of an e-commerce system without actual sales or integration with a database.

## How to use

To use it, simply clone the repository and then use the "npm start" command.
